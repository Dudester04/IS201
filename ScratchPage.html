            Media buying is the process of purchasing advertising space across various platforms — 
            such as websites, social media, television, radio, or print — to promote a product, service, 
            or brand to a specific audience. It involves identifying the most effective channels, negotiating 
            rates, and strategically placing ads to maximize exposure and return on investment (ROI). Media 
            buying typically happens in two ways: Direct Buying – Negotiating ad placements manually with media 
            outlets, and Programmatic Buying – Using automated platforms (like DSPs) to buy ad space in real-time 
            through algorithms and data. Ultimately, media buying is not just about placing ads — it's about placing 
            the right ads, in the right places, at the right time.
